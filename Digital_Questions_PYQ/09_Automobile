Problem Statement â€“ An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    int v, w;
    cin >> v >> w;
    float x = ((4 * v) - w) / 2;
    if ((w & 1) || w < 2 || w <= v)
    {
        cout << "INVALID INPUT";
        return 0;
    }
    cout << "TW=" << x << " " << "FW=" << v - x;

}
